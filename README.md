# Sentimental-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis from Ratings-Based Reviews Built a multi-class sentiment classifier using customer review text and star ratings. Converted ratings (1â€“5) into sentiment labels (negative, neutral, positive), trained multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and deployed a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
